# Metal-distortion
## Deep Convolutional Neural Network CNN for distortion classification of hot rolling metal

## Abtract: 
Deep learning in industrial applications is becoming incredibly beneficial due to its promising performance. Here I have used CNN model to detect and classify deformation in hot roling metal where sensors are not applicable because of the high temperature. Find the code in link below, written in Python using Tensorflow toolbox.

### All the python code is writen in one single file.py
